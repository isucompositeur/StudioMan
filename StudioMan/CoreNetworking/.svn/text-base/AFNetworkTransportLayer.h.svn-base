    \brief
	An AFNetworkTransportLayer object should encapsulate data (as defined in IETF-RFC-1122 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122)
 
	\details
	This implementation mandates that a layer pass data to it's superclass for further processing, the top-level superclass will pass the data to the lower layer. This creates a cluster-chain allowing for maximum flexiblity.
