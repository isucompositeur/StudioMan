/*!
    \brief
	Primarily an extention of the CFSocketStream API. Originally named for that purpose as 'AFSocketStream' though the name was changed so not to imply the exclusive use of SOCK_STREAM.
	
    \details
	This class is a mix of two of the primary patterns:
	• Internally, it acts an adaptor between the CFSocketRef and CFStreamRef API.
	• Externally, it bridges CFHostRef and CFNetServiceRef with CFSocketRef and CFStreamRef providing an asyncronous CFStreamRef like API.
